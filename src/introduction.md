# Introduction

Welcome to the [Maker Space](https://www.makerspace.org.uk/) wiki!

Here you will find (hopefully) all the information you could possibly want to know about our hackspace, how it works, what facilities we have and how to use them.

## But really, what is this?

This is a demo wiki, if you are looking for the current wiki then head [here](https://makerspace.pbworks.com/).

This contains the actual proposal to change from our existing wiki to something very like this as well as a couple of demo pages that were either quick to write, quick to migrate or generously donated as part of testing.
