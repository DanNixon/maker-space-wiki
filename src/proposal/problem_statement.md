# Problem Statement

In short, our current wiki is very decrepid.

- Only a handful of pages contain actually useful information
- Findability is pretty much non-existent
- The site has injected adverts from the hosting provider
- It does not support TLS, so generates a warning in most modern browsers
- It is not mobile friendly
- It is not very print friendly
- It generally looks pretty bad

The problem is certain both content and platform, however having a platform that generates actually nice documentation from a commonly used markup would certainly be a starting point in having more documentation written and kept up to date.
