# The Wiki Proposal

This section outlines the proposal to replace our [existing wiki](http://makerspace.pbworks.com) with one based on [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) (like you are reading right now!).

- [Problem Statement](./problem_statement.md): outlining what is wrong with the current wiki and why we need a replacement
- [Solutions Considered](./solutions_considered.md): an overview of each considered solution that could address the issues with the current wiki
- [Proposed Solution](./proposed_solution/): what I am actually suggesting we do about it
- [Hypothetically Asked Questions](./hypothetically_asked_questions.md): questions that I imagine people might have

## Feedback

I welcome all feedback, but am particularly interested in hearing from wiki authors (both present and potential), given that they are the ones for whom there is a trade-off in the proposed solution, namely the slightly more complex edit/contribution workflow.

If anything is unclear, given me a shout and I'll add more details as required.
Feel free to poke around the repository all you like, the link is to the top right of the page (the GitHub logo).
If you are interested to see the Cloudflare side of it, give me a shout and I can show you how this looks on the dashboard (although I assure you, it is not that thrilling).
