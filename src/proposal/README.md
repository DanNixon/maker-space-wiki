# The Wiki Proposal

This section outlines the proposal to replace our [existing wiki](http://makerspace.pbworks.com) with one based on [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) (like you are reading right now!).

- [Problem Statement](./problem_statement.md): outlining what is wrong with the current wiki and why we need a replacement
- [Solutions Considered](./solutions_considered.md): an overview of each considered solution that could address the issues with the current wiki
- [Proposed Solution](./proposed_solution/): what I am actually suggesting we do about it
- [Hypothetically Asked Questions](./hypothetically_asked_questions.md): questions that I imagine people might have

## Feedback

I welcome all feedback, but am particularly interested in hearing from wiki authors (both present and potential), given that they are the ones for whom there is a trade-off in the proposed solution, namely the slightly more complex edit/contribution workflow.
